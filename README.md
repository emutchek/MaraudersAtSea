Pooja Huded and Erin Mutchek 

Iteration 2 Functionality Implemented:
<ul>
<li>Implemented moving the ship and interacting with the islands along the way in Android Studio</li>
<li>Implemented the StoryScenes that show up when an island is reached, along with the user decisions associated with those story scenes in Android Studio. </li>
<li>Wrote and tested JUnit tests for all the Java classes </li>
<li>Wrote and tested Android Studio Espresso  </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Note: Limited functionality due to an error associated with the view hierarchy/layout. The test is unable to find/interact with any Views associated with the StoryViewFragment class. This error does not limit playability, only the testing.  </li>
    </ul>
<li>Limited functionality: It isn't possible to interact with resource areas, inventory, map, health, or obstacles as of yet. Coming soon...  </li>
</ul>
