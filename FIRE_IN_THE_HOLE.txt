Technical to do:
- make new tests - find a javascript testing framework


In the future ideas:
- customize ship appearance, name, etc. at the beginning 
- Eurydice's journal showing all the story user has encountered so far
- Island shape corresponds to the story



Money:
- introduce money as the incentive to make the map (more money the more detailed it is)
- how does the player earn money throughout the game? bad choices on islands?

Map:
- the map gets stolen by an EHE lackey, players have no choice about it getting sent in
- if they make enough good decisions, they're able to help thwart the big attack and join the
  revolution; if not, they watch the island burn and rot in hell
- there's a series of main islands that everybody hits, with little detours to rack up doubt meter
- there's a small chance (~30%) of getting a pure fluff island, unrelated to the tree
  ---> fluff islands have NO question
- doubt meter is a ratio; around 75% through the game we determine which ending they'll get
- every island has a decision, but unless it's a fork in the tree, it affects money/inventory/relationships
