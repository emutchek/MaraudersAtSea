Technical to do:
- make new JUnit tests



In the future ideas:
- trading posts: money system? betraying your values for capitalism????
- customize ship appearance, name, etc. at the beginning 
- Eurydice's journal showing all the story user has encountered so far
- Island shape corresponds to the story
- interact with NPC

Iteration 1:
- grid that randomly generates JUST TEXT as you reach islands and resource areas
- can move ship (low-level interaction- recognize but nothing further)
- key plot-point islands always show up, filler episodes are rotated in from a larger pool

Iteration 2:
- convert all on-screen text to reading in a file
- create inventory, ability to pick up resource area items (much higher cap, more messing around)
- track health
- generate obstacles, consume resources

Iteration 3:
- 'doubt' system
