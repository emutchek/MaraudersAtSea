## Target Audience
<p>Our app is designed to be played by anyone ages 10 and up who enjoys 
video games. It will be especially popular with fans of popular fantasy 
franchises. The app is geared towards players who prefer a more story-driven
experience versus intense combat.</p>

## Value Proposition
<p>Our app will provide entertainment by placing the user in a compelling
world. They will have the opportunity to explore the intricacies of a 
different society and confront their own role in systems of power. It will 
also be funny.</p>

## Main Features
<p>The primary mechanic of the game is a grid upon which the user navigates
a pirate ship. The app displays a bird's eye view of the ocean and
everything the ship passes (e.g. enemy ships, small islands, floating 
debris). As the user moves forward, they can interact with these obstacles
and accumulate resources. The story of the game will progress through
pop-up dialogues which will prompt decisions for the crew to make. They
will also face random setbacks in a system similar to the Oregon Trail game.
The goal of the game is to complete the mission without the ship, or its
inhabitants, perishing. Their progress will be tracked through a health bar.
