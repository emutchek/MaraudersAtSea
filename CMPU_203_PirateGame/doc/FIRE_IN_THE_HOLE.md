### Problems Staring us in the Face

<ul>
<li>They need to be able to launch the inventory/map/pause screen while they're reading an obstacle card or else how will
they know if they have the stuff</li>
<li>If they refuse to put something on the map, we still need to know they got there</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

### Random to dos
<li>Add rubber/steel-like resource to glossary and give name</li>

### Doubt Meter
<p>Things like peeking at the diary and interrogating locals about the grove will
drive up the user's doubt meter (e.g. their level of suspicion about the true nature
of the mission). There will be subtle hints throughout scenes 1-6. 

At that point, if their doubt is high enough, they receive alternate versions of scenes 
7-9 wherein they learn more about the shady client, the recent conquering of Helion, and the 
potential value of the Vironium (all these clues are unrelated so that if later on,
they only see a few, they still make sense). 

In the non-alternate timeline, there is one more opportunity to increase the doubt meter.
At the end, if the doubt meter is above 0, they have a choice whether to send in the letter.
Otherwise, it gets sent automatically.</p>
