### Random to dos/reminders
<li>Add vironium to glossary </li>
<li>Pause screen, map, inventory, health button must always be accessible, even when story card is up</li>

### Doubt Meter
<p>Things like peeking at the diary and interrogating locals about the grove will
drive up the user's doubt meter (e.g. their level of suspicion about the true nature
of the mission). There will be subtle hints throughout scenes 1-6. 

At that point, if their doubt is high enough, they receive alternate versions of scenes 
7-9 wherein they learn more about the shady client, the recent conquering of Helion, and the 
potential value of the Vironium (all these clues are unrelated so that if later on,
they only see a few, they still make sense). 

In the non-alternate timeline, there is one more opportunity to increase the doubt meter.
At the end, if the doubt meter is above 0, they have a choice whether to send in the letter.
Otherwise, it gets sent automatically.</p>

### Stuff to figure out
<ul>
<li>If we randomly generate resource area objects, do they get stored in some list?
Cause the grid is just an array of strings. But how do we print info about it and access
what type of resource it is?</li>
<li>Access modifiers</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
