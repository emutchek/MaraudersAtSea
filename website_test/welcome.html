    <h1>MARAUDERS AT SEA</h1>
    <p id="mainText">Once Upon A Time, there was a faraway land called ____. It was a land like any 
        other: friendships to make, glory to seek, grudges to hold. You could find all sorts of people 
        if you sailed long enough, inventors living in deserts and assassins hiding in jungles and 
        singers on drifting islands. But to travel the waves meant risking a run-in with a ship full 
        of pirates. Fueled by rum and strapped with swords, these women lived in infamy for their 
        fearlessness. There was one crew in particular who earned such a reputation that their names 
        continued to be whispered one hundred years after they last treaded the land.
        The crew had a brave and noble captain, of course, by the name of Eurydice. Her first mate, 
        Cas, was slightly less noble but just as brave - and incredibly dashing. The pair had grown 
        inseparable after meeting on the Isle of Pirates, a trading post for gossiping, carrousing, 
        and selling merchandise of questionable origin. Luckily, they also met a couple level-headed 
        sailors along the way: Amira and Ish, both temporarily applying their intelligence to pirating 
        to earn a few coin. Together, the four of them did decently well for themselves. On one journey, 
        though, they found themselves rescued by a strange woman named Orlic, who happily accepted a post 
        on the crew despite having almost no discernible talents or knowledge of sailing whatsoever. 
        Of couse, this legend began long before those pirates got twisted up in it, leaving whispers 
        in their wake. It’s actually a story you’ve heard before. But maybe, with you here… maybe 
        you’ll tell it a different way.<br>
