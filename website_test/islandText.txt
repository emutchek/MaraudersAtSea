:First encounter w/ locals; they're worried that more of you are coming. 
Give them something, or hold back in case they're untrustworthy?
:Give it to them
:Do not give it to them

:Along the shortcut, you come across a disease-ridden bug attack. 
Luckily, the route was short and you come across locals with medicine in enough time to cure the crew.
Ask the locals for help (cost something) or simply steal the medicine needed?
:I will ask for help.
:I will just take it

:Inside a cave, you discover bones and an elaborate trap holding unknown riches.
Go for the treasure, or salvage the skeletons and flee?
:Grab the skeletons and flee, we'll give them a proper burial
:The way's been cleared, we have a good shot at the treasure
:Find EHE dogtags on the bones; realize they match the seal of the letter

:Go camping w/ locals. They have a diary, and at night, nobody is looking.
:Don't look, what if they wake up?
:Peek at their papers.
:Because they trust you, the locals bring you to the grove
:Learn about grove & the creatures who protect it

:Locals show you the healing magic of the grove. They ask you not to put it on map.
:Sure, we'll leave it off

:Reach grove by memory; you assume it may be harmful & mark it on the map.
Do you want to take some as a sample? It's probably worth a lot.
:No, that's not my job
:Of course, we struck gold
:You left it alone, so you get doubt meter points

:Attend local festival, where you hear rumors of incoming attack. Do you tell them what you know?
:Yes, they deserve to be alert at least

:Map is stolen by lackeys. You are now sure that your mission was past exploratory. 
Do you turn around to confront your bosses, or try to find some locals to fess up to?
:We have to tell someone now
:There may be time to stop them
:You find some locals who agree to travel with you to a bigger island.
:You begin proceeding backwards, but are stopped by some locals who insist that you accompany them
to a big strategy meeting

:Map is stolen by lackeys. You are now sure that your mission was past exploratory. The lackeys
force their way onto your ship and insist on escorting you back to the Isle of Pirates so you won't
interfere with their work. You run into some locals and offer to help them, but they refuse you. You've
given their enemies the map, and for that they will suffer. Some question

:At the meeting, everyone is upset that you made the map. However, because of the good will you've 
shown, they choose to give you another chance to prove yourself. You learn that local scouts report 
an armada approaching to colonize the islands; your crew joins the war effort. Some profound,
epilogue question.
