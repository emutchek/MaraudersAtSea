### Doubt Meter
<p>Things like peeking at the diary and interrogating locals about the grove will
drive up the user's doubt meter (e.g. their level of suspicion about the true nature
of the mission). There will be subtle hints throughout scenes 1-6. 

At that point, if their doubt is high enough, they don't see the Vironium and instead
they learn about EHE from the locals. 

In both timelines, there is one more opportunity to increase the doubt meter.
At the end, if the doubt meter is above 0, they have a choice whether to send in the letter.
Otherwise, it gets sent automatically.</p>
